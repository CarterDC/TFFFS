# [Subject Title]

## 1. Overview / Introduction

* **What this page covers:** Briefly explain the purpose of this page and what the reader will learn or achieve.
* **Why this is important / What problem it solves:** Provide context and motivation. Why did you implement this? What benefits does it offer (e.g., security, convenience, specific functionality)?
* **Key concepts / Prerequisites:** List any fundamental concepts the reader should understand before proceeding, or any prior steps that must be completed (e.g., "Assumes you have a working Debian installation," "Basic understanding of networking").

## 2. Planning / Design Choices (Optional but Recommended)

* **Goals:** What were your specific goals for this implementation?
* **Alternative solutions considered (and why you chose this one):** This is incredibly valuable for future reference. Why did you pick `mkdocs` over `sphinx`, or `SSH keys` over `password-only` authentication?
* **System architecture / Network diagram (if applicable):** A simple diagram (you can use Mermaid.js with Material for MkDocs!) can clarify complex setups.

## 3. Implementation Steps

This section should be a clear, step-by-step tutorial. Each step should have a goal and the commands to achieve it.

### 3.1. [Sub-topic 1: e.g., Installing Necessary Packages]

* **Objective:** What are you trying to accomplish in this sub-step?
* **Explanation:** Briefly explain *why* these packages are needed or what this command does.
* **Commands:** Use code blocks with language highlighting. If a command requires root privileges, indicate it.
    ```bash
    sudo apt update
    sudo apt install <package-name> # Explain why this package is needed
    ```
* **Expected Output (Optional but helpful):** Show a truncated or key part of the command's output so the reader knows what to expect.
    ```
    Output example...
    ```
* **Notes / Troubleshooting:** Any specific considerations, common issues, or tips for this step.

### 3.2. [Sub-topic 2: e.g., Configuration]

* **Objective:** What configuration are you setting up?
* **Explanation:** Detail the purpose of configuration files, specific parameters, and their impact.
* **Commands (for editing files):**
    ```bash
    sudo nano /etc/config/file.conf
    ```
* **File Content (using a code block for the file itself):**
    ```ini linenums="1" hl_lines="5 7-8"
    # Example configuration file
    [Section]
    Parameter1 = value1
    # This line is important
    Parameter2 = value2 # This value does X
    AnotherParameter = 0
    # Enable this for Y
    YetAnother = true
    ```
    *Use `linenums` and `hl_lines` as you mentioned for excellent clarity.*
* **Validation Commands (e.g., `systemctl status`):**
    ```bash
    systemctl status service-name
    ```
* **Expected Output:**
    ```
    ‚óè service-name.service - Description
         Loaded: loaded (/lib/systemd/system/service-name.service; enabled; vendor preset: enabled)
         Active: active (running) since ...
    ```
* **Notes / Troubleshooting:** Any specific considerations, common issues, or tips for this step.

## 4. Verification / Testing

* **How to confirm everything is working:** Provide commands or steps to test the successful implementation.
    ```bash
    ssh user@your-server-ip # To test SSH connection
    ```
* **Expected outcome:** What should the user see or experience if the implementation is successful?

---

## 5. Usage / Daily Operations (if applicable)

* **Common commands:** List commands for daily use (e.g., "How to check SSH logs," "How to add a new SSH key").
    ```bash
    journalctl -u sshd.service
    ```
* **Tips and tricks:** Any useful shortcuts or best practices.

---

## 6. Maintenance / Future Considerations

* **Backup strategies:** How to back up relevant configurations or data.
* **Updating the package/service:** How to keep it updated.
* **Potential issues and solutions:** Foresee any common problems that might arise in the future and how to address them.
* **Scalability / Future enhancements:** Ideas for extending or improving the setup later.

## 7. Resources / Further Reading

* **Official documentation:** Link to man pages, official project documentation, etc.
* **Useful articles/tutorials:** Any external sources that helped you.
* **Related documentation pages:** Link to other pages within your personal documentation that are relevant.
